*** UID Authentication Client Reference Implementation ***
==========================================================


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------

PRE-REQUISITES:

1. JDK 1.6 Update 20 or Higher
2. Maven 2.2.1 or Higher
   a) Download Maven from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/maven/binaries/apache-maven-2.2.1-bin.zip
   b) Unzip the zip file.
   c) Add the "bin" folder of extracted zip file into PATH so that you can run "mvn" command from command line.
   d) Test by running "mvn" from command line, you should see output like below:
   D:\auth-client-workspace\release_1.2_bugfix\bundler>mvn -version
         Apache Maven 2.2.1 (r788681; 2009-06-26 18:34:01+0530)
         Java version: 1.6.0_20
         Java home: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\jre
         Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: Cp1252
         OS name: "windows 7" version: "6.1" arch: "x86" Family: "windows"
3. Protoc compiler for converting protobuf message templates into java source code.
   For Windows, download protobuf compiler version http://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protoc-2.4.1-win32.zip.
   The zip file contains "protoc.exe", Place the "protoc.exe" in PATH.  Open a command prompt and run the command
   "protoc --version".  You should see the version number listed as "libprotoc 2.4.1".

   For Linux, you will have to build the "protoc" from source.
   

PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS:
====================
- uidai-auth-proto-model: This project contains Protobuf Message format and builds Java objects by using protoc compiler
- uidai-auth-xsd-model: This project contains auth XSDs and builds JAXB objects by using xjc compiler
- uidai-auth-client: This project code encryption related code, and code to submit requests to auth server.
- uidai-sample-gui-app: This project contains a sample GUI application.
- uidai-biometric-integration-api: This project defines an API that can be used to integrate with biometric device library.


BUILDING FROM SOURCE:
=====================
  	 
1. Run "mvn clean package -DskipTests" from directory UID_CLIENT_PROJECT_HOME (where you unzipped source code).

2. To develop code in Eclipse, perform following steps:
   i)   Run "mvn eclipse:eclipse" from UID_CLIENT_PROJECT_HOME directory.
   ii)  Launch Eclipse and create a new workspace.
   iii) Right click in an empty area in "Project Explorer", and select menu option "Import...".
   iv)  In the "Import" dialog, select option "General -> Existing project into workspace",
        and browse to directory UID_CLIENT_PROJECT_HOME for option "Select root directory:".
        Click "Finish"
   v)   All the projects will be imported in Eclipse.
        If you see build errors complaining that lots of JARs are missing in build path, then, that is because
		we use Maven and all the JARs are include as a relative path to "M2_REPO" class path variable.  To fix this,
		do the following steps:
		  a) Select menu "Window -> Preferences".
		  b) Select the option " Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables" in the "Preferences" dialog.
		  c) Create a new variable with name "M2_REPO" and its value should be the path of your local Maven Repository.
		     By default, it will be "C:\Users\<your-windows-user-id>\.m2\repository". Example: C:\Users\Administrator\.m2\repository.
   vi)  If you have project that provides biometric integration API implementation, you will have to add it to the class path of
        the "uidai-sample-gui-app" project.  Also, update the value of field, biometricAPIImplementationClass, in the SampleClientMainFrame.java
		to the value of the class that implements the API.
   vi)  Select the "SampleClientMainFrame.java" file from "uidai-sample-gui-app" project
        and run it as a "Java" application.

   After launching the application, Use menu "Edit->Preferences" and modify values as needed.
